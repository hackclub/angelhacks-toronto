What to expect
AngelHacks Toronto will take place at WeWork Office Space & Coworking, 1st University Avenue, Toronto on May 27th, 2023. We’ll share some more information on how to get there and other specifics soon. But If you plan on taking public transit, the venue is near both Union and St. Andrew’s Station.

The event starts at 9 am and ends at 9 pm & doors open at 8:45 am.  Please try to arrive before 9:15 am. If you think you might be late, please let us know ahead of time. 

You’ll need a laptop, a charger, your student ID (or a similar document proving your age), and anything else you might need for your project & for the duration of the event.

Food + Other
We’re still ironing out details for lunch and dinner. Currently, we plan on serving Subway for Lunch, and Pizza Pizza for Dinner. For participants with dietary concerns, we will be offering stipends to cover food and delivery. We suggest having breakfast before the event 

We also have water, snacks, and other drinks throughout the event!

Open Call For Workshops
There will be 4 workshops at Angelhacks Toronto, and there are 2 confirmed right now (with more slots set if there’s interest!)!

So far we have two workshops:


How to make a game with JS w/ Sprig
How to make a game with Python (Pygame)

If you’re interested in hosting a workshop (~1hr) or have any ideas, please let us know as soon as possible!

Waivers
In the next day or so, we’ll send your parents a link to a form to fill out the waiver for the event. The subject will be ‘Waiver for AngelHacks Toronto – Please Sign’ (check the spam folder). Both you and your parents will have to fill out the waiver to attend the event!

Please fill out the waiver as soon as possible, before May 25th, 2023. 
You cannot attend the event without a signed waiver. 

If you or your parents have any questions or concerns about the waiver, please feel free to reach out!


Lastly, we need your help getting AngelHacks out to more people! If you could take a chance and share the event with your friends or classmates, that would be awesome! Additionally, we’ll be sending another email with more information closer to the event date.

P.S. If you haven’t joined the Slack and #angelhacks-toronto, we’re organizing this event completely in the open. If you’re interested in seeing some of the logistics or want to suggest ideas for the event, you should totally join! You can sign up here if you haven’t already
